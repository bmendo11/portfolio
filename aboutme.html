         <h2> Day 9 </h2>
         I am excited for the future of robotics because the potential brought before us with robotics feels like it could bring us safety by dodging any of our poor decision making and imperfect repetition like we were discussing in class, but I am also nervous about the new can of worms it will open like how we will prevent or deal with hacking or all the jobs that could potentially disappear. Today went well because we were able to experiment with circuits and find out what worked and what didn't on our own, as well as why something worked or didn't work.
