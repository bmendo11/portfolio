         <h2> Day 9 </h2>
         I am excited for the future of robotics because the potential brought before us with robotics feels like it could bring us safety by dodging any of our poor decision making and imperfect repetition like we were discussing in class, but I am also nervous about the new can of worms it will open like how we will prevent or deal with hacking or all the jobs that could potentially disappear. Today went well because we were able to experiment with circuits and find out what worked and what didn't on our own, as well as why something worked or didn't work.
         
         <h2> Day 10 </h2>
         Today we built a lightshow. Since we were given permission to think creativly through the project, our team planned to make a show that will have lights following the notes and rythmic patterns of hot cross buns as it plays in the peizo. Unfortunately, we were limited by time and were unable to accomplish as much as we have hoped. However, we were able to create the light pattern for hot cross buns, which is considered a light show and still holds accomplishment within itself. Some challenges included understanding the code for the Arduino, specifically loops, and working through moments where we knew something should have worked then finding out why it didn't.
