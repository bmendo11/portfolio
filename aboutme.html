  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hey, I'm Bella. I live in a little town called Whitter and attend La Serna High School. Through my entire life, I've consumed 64,240,000 liters of oxygen and counting. I've been playing music since I was 52,560 hours old and I enjoy doing so. I've recently developed a love for old literature, specifically plays and poetry.   </p>

  <h2> I Love...</h2>
