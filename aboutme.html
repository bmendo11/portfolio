    <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
  <p>Hey, I'm Bella. I live in a little town called Whitter and attend La Serna High School. Through my entire life, I've consumed 64,240,000 liters of oxygen and counting. I've been playing music since I was 52,560 hours old and I enjoy doing so. I've recently developed a love for old literature, specifically plays and poetry.   </p>

  <h2> I Love...</h2>
    <p> <ul>
    <li> Music
      <li> Vans
        <li> Oxygen
    </ul>
    <h2> I Dislike...</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> People who don't know how to lace their shoes correctly
        <li> Spicy stuff
          <li> Country Music
    </ul>
